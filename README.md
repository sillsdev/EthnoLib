This is a small collection of browser components for language apps. Each is published to its own npm package.

## About the monorepo

Ethnolib is a [monorepo](https://nx.dev/concepts/decisions/why-monorepos) using nx.

We recommend installing nx globally.
`npm i -g nx`

But if you don't, you can just prefix all the commands with `npx`

Nx caches builds for efficiency. If at any point you need to clear your local cache, run `nx reset`
